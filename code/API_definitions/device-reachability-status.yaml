  title: Device Reachability Status
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to query device reachability status.

    # Introduction

    ## Reachability Status

    API consumer is able to verify whether a certain user device is reachable from the network via data- or sms-usage.

    ## Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    * **Reachability** : Reachability status.
      - `CONNECTED_SMS`, if device is connected to the network via SMS usage
      - `CONNECTED_DATA`, if device is connected to the network via data usage
      - `NOT_CONNECTED`, if device is not connected to the network

    * **LastStatusTime** : This property specifies the time when the status was last updated. Its presence in the response indicates the freshness of the information, while its absence implies the information may be outdated or its freshness is uncertain.

    ## API Functionality

    The API exposes following capabilities:

    ### Device Reachability situation

    The endpoint `POST /retrieve` allows to get current connectivity status information synchronously.

    ## Authorization and authentication

    [Camara Security and Interoperability Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-Security-Interoperability.md) provides details on how a client requests an access token.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.

    DeviceIpv6Address:
      description: |
        The device should be identified by the observed IPv6 address, or by any single IPv6 address from within the subnet allocated to the device (e.g. adding ::0 to the /64 prefix).
